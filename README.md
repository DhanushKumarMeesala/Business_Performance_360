5. Features / Highlights
‚Ä¢ Business Problem
Organizations struggle with fragmented data across departments (sales, finance, supply chain), leading to delayed insights and reactive decision-making. Key challenges include:

Identifying profitability leaks (e.g., negative net profit in India/LATAM).

Balancing inventory risk (Excess Inventory vs. Out-of-Stock scenarios).

Optimizing customer and product mix for margin growth.

‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard

Provide a single source of truth for cross-functional performance tracking.

Highlight actionable insights (e.g., high-GM customers like Neptune, supply chain risks in NE/SE regions).

Enable scenario planning (e.g., impact of cost reductions on net profit).
